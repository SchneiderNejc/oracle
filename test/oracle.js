/* Let's create a CallerContractInterface named callerContractInstance.
Initialize callerContractInstance with the address of the caller contract, just like we did with myContractInstance above.
Note that the address of the caller contract should come from the function parameters.
Run the callerContractInstance.callback function, passing it _ethPrice and _id.
    Lastly, emit the SetLatestEthPriceEvent.It takes two parameters: _ethPrice and _callerAddress. */
